## Abstract
Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge
of the robotâ€™s structure, material properties, and other physical
characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity
of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The
mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred
to another domain with different physical properties. This chal-
lenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials
gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle
generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge
transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we
employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller
trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with
tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and
orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through
trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and
further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively
facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

## To Run the algorithm
- Create a virtual conda environment
  ```bash
  conda env create -f elastica_2022.yml
  ```
- Activate the virtual environmnet
  ```bash
  conda activate elastica_2022
  ```
- Move to the directory
  
- Attach the pyelastica simulator or any other simulator you want
  
- Then just run the main script
  ```bash
  python3 main_CGANWGP_bothXee_pressure.py
  ```
- Change the path for the actuations and the corresponding end-effector poses
- Train the cycle GAN network with the default parameters or change it if required
